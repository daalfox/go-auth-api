# Auth api in Go

## Naive implementation

This is the easiest way to get started when you need to implement
something for the first time and you don't know the domain.
You make a simple prototype and then when you know the domain you can
add tests, config, etc. according to your needs.

In this step you don't need to implement everything, just enough to
understand the domain.
